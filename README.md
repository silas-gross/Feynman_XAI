# Feynman_XAI
Final project for CUNY Graduate AI class. 
Using Feynman diagrams to set a renormalization scheme on a dataset and comparing the structure induced by the renomalization scheme to that of a bayes net learned from the data to improve infernce speeds and towards an exact mapping between renormalization and AI models in a similar way to DNNs as was shown by Mehta and Schwab (arXiv:1410.3831)
